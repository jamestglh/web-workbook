  <h6 class="center"><b>Work Experience:</b> <br /><br />

  <b>  Jungle Disk</b> | Senior Escalation Tech | January 2016 – Present<br />

<br />
  	At Jungle Disk I am the senior-most tech on the Support team. I work with the lower tier techs to
    solve a myriad of issues pertaining to our software (and more).<br />
<br />
<b>Cyber Talk Radio</b> | Producer and Audio Engineer  | June 2016 – present<br />

<br />
  	Cyber Talk Radio is a weekly cybersecurity talk show that airs every Saturday night at 11pm on WOAI.
    I record and engineer every episode, then edit it to its final form to be broadcast. We are about 80 episodes in as of April 2018<br />
<br />

<b>Rackspace</b> | Tier 1 Support Tech | January 2015 – January 2016<br />

<br />
  	At Rackspace I joined the Jungle Disk team as a tier 1 support member. As an entry level tech, I helped
    our customers with software issues while learning as much as I could about the software and systems that run it.<br />
<br />
  <b>San Antonio School for Inquiry and Creativity</b> | Art teacher | May 2014-December 2014<br />

<br />
  	At SASIC, I taught Art, Digital Art, and Photography at the high school level.<br />
<br />

  <b>Healy-Murphy Center</b> | Art, English, and Journalism teacher | Aug 2012 – July 2014<br />
<br />
  	At Healy-Murphy, I taught Art, English, and Journalism classes to at-risk youth at the high 	school level.<br />
<br />

  <b>McNay Art Museum</b> | Preparator | May - Jun 2012<br />
<br />
  	At the McNay, I helped install and uninstall art shows, and then package and ship the art.
    Responsibilities include handling and packaging incredibly expensive works of art and 	installing
    new incoming shows, working directly with the curator and the artists to make 	the show the best it can be.
    This is a contract job that lasts three weeks a few times a year.

<h6 class="center"><b>Extracurricular Activities:</b>
I am a long-time musician. I play several instruments, but I am most proficient at guitar. I've been in the band
<a href="http://thegrasshopperliesheavy.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">The Grasshopper Lies Heavy</a> for over a decade, and we have toured countless times and have released several records on different record labels across the country.
I recently <a href="https://thegrasshopperliesheavy.bandcamp.com/album/cavern" target="_blank">wrote and recorded a film score</a>, which is one of my long-term goals. I hope to do more film work in the future. <br /> <br />
