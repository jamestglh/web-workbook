      <p>James Woodard is a tech nerd, former high school teacher, and debilitatingly
          permanent musician. He was the kind of kid that took apart and put back
          together his bike under the Christmas tree before he even rode it. He screwed
          up his first guitar the day he bought it by taking it apart and not knowing
          how to put it back together again. Only through sinewy, bloody determination
          does James Woodard achieve. </p>
     <p>Profesionally, he ditched teaching high school art in 2015 for an
          opportunity at a tech company that he couldn't pass up. Easily and
          unquestioningly shedding his meager teacher salary for a few more handfuls of
          change a week, he worked to become the senior most escalation tech in his
          company's application support team. Here he stands today, at the plateau of
          his support career, ready to walk right off of the cliff into web development. </p>
     <p>Throughout his adult life, James Woodard has made music, mostly under the
          moniker The Grasshopper Lies Heavy. He has released several records through
          various record labels, with his band or solo, under the moniker. </p>
     <p>James unfortunately decided to squander his college career seeking a degree
          in studio art. As a painter, he has had several solo and group exhibitions in
          the San Antonio area.  </p>
     <p>As a final message, James would like to ask you to buy one of his records,
          available at the bandcamp link below. </p>
