Bio 

James Woodard is a tech nerd, former high school teacher, and debilitatingly permanent musician. He was the kind of kid that took apart and put back together his bike under the Christmas tree before he even rode it. He screwed up his first guitar the day he bought it by taking it apart and not knowing how to put it back together again. Only through sinewy, bloody determination does James Woodard achieve. 

Profesionally, he ditched teaching art in high school in 2015 for an opportunity at a tech company that he couldn't pass up. Easily and unquestioningly shedding his meager teacher salary for a few more handfuls of change a week, he worked to become the senior most escalation tech in his company's application support team. Here he stands today, at the plateau of his support career, ready to walk right off of the cliff into web development. 

Throughout his adult life, James Woodard has made music, mostly under the moniker The Grasshopper Lies Heavy. He has released several records through various record labels, with his band or solo, under the moniker. 

James unfortunately decided to squander his college career seeking a degree in studio art. As a painter, he has had several solo and group exhibitions in the San Antonio area.  

As a final message, James would like to ask you to buy one of his records, available at the bandcamp link below.
